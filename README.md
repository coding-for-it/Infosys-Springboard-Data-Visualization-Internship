# Infosys-Springboard-Data-Visualization-Internship

This repository contains the deliverables from my Infosys Data Visualization Internship, where I developed an interactive financial forecasting dashboard using Power BI. 
The project showcases the application of data analysis, modeling, and visualization techniques to aid financial decision-making.

Project Overview
Financial forecasting is a critical aspect of business decision-making. This project focuses on transforming raw financial data into actionable insights using Power BI's advanced visualization capabilities. 
The interactive dashboard facilitates predictions of future financial outcomes, providing stakeholders with key metrics such as revenue, expenses, and profit margins.

Scope of the Project
This project encompasses the full lifecycle of data analysis and visualization:

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Cleaned and standardized financial data.
Forecasting Models: Applied techniques like moving averages and exponential smoothing.
Dashboard Design: Developed an interactive interface with real-time insights.
Stakeholder Focus: Enhanced decision-making through key performance metrics.

Project Objectives
Transform raw financial data into dynamic visualizations.
Implement advanced forecasting techniques to predict key outcomes.
Design an intuitive dashboard with interactive features.
Enable stakeholders to analyze trends and make data-driven decisions.

Key Features
Interactive Dashboards: Visualize financial data with dynamic slicers and filters.
Forecasting Models: Predict future performance using statistical techniques.
Real-Time Analysis: Leverage DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for up-to-date insights.
Custom Visualizations: Incorporate bar charts, line graphs, maps, and KPIs.

Tools and Technologies
Power BI: For data transformation, modeling, and dashboard design.
Excel/CSV: For importing and preprocessing data.
DAX: For advanced calculations and measures.
